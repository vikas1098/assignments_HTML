                    <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.

                        A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet.</p>
