                <ul>
                    <p>Step 1 Chop all the veggies and make almond-cashew paste
                        To prepare this creamy shahi paneer recipe, chop the onion, green chillies, tomatoes along with ginger and coriander leaves separately. Now in a bowl, add the curd and whisk it well. If you are in a hurry, you can also use tomato puree instead of chopped tomatoes. To make this recipe more delicious, you can dry roast the spices separately and then add them to the gravy. This will make your recipe more aromatic. Now, grind cashews and almonds separately using a little water and make cashew and almond paste. Keep them aside until required.</p>
                    <p>Step 2 Prepare onion-tomato gravy using curd
                        Next, put a pan on medium flame and heat 3 tbsps of ghee in it. Add the chopped onions, ginger, green chillies along with green cardamoms for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. Then, add the beaten curd, cook for another 5 minutes and pour a cup of water into the pan. Cook for another 2 minutes. When the gravy is cooked, let it cool down at room temperature. When it's cool enough, add it to a mixer jar and blend till smooth and keep aside.</p>
                    <p>Step 3 Add paneer cubes in the gravy and cook for 3-5 minutes
                        Now, heat the remaining ghee in another pan and add the ground gravy in it along with red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cashew and almond paste along with salt. Bring it to a boil or till the gravy thickens. Then add the paneer cubes and milk. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. While the gravy is being cooked, cut the paneer into cubes and keep it aside till required. Take two cubes and grate them for garnishing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Step 4 Garnish and serve
                        Garnish this delicious North Indian paneer recipe with chopped coriander leaves and grated paneer. If you like it creamier, you can add some fresh cream. This will not only make your dish look appetising but at the same time, it will add to the taste. Serve hot with roomali roti or naan and enjoy!</p>

                            <li> 1 teaspoon red chilli powder </li>

                            <li> salt as required </li>
                            <li> 2 inch chopped ginger </li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon refined oil </li>
                            <li> 2 medium sliced & slit green chilli </li>
                            <li> 1 teaspoon garam masala powder </li>
                            <li> 1/2 cup soaked overnight urad dal </li>
                            <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic paste </li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>Step 1 Soak urad, rajma overnight & pressure cook the next day
                        To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in three cups of water. Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with salt as per taste. This makes the rajma and dal soft.</p>

                    <p>Step 2 Fry the onions, green chillies & tomato puree
                        Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds crackle, you can add half the ginger-garlic paste and stir for some time. Then add some onions, chopped green chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are someone who loves the authentic style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest you to use ghee instead of oil.</p>

                    <p>Step 3 Add the rajma & dal
                        Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and dal, and bring to a boil. If you want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma.</p>

                    <p>Step 4 Add the garam masala & garnish with fresh cream & coriander leaves
                        Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to boil, if you think that the dal is too thick, you can add some water. Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will make your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh cream and freshly chopped coriander leaves.</p>

                   <p>Step 1
                    To prepare this scrumptious recipe, wash and peel the avocados and keep it aside. Heat 2 cups of water in a bowl and add the peeled avocados in it.

                <ul>
                   <p>Step 1 Chop the veggies
                    Firstly, chop all the veggies like onion, carrot, capsicum, cauliflower, baby corn, beans into small pieces and set them aside. Also, chop the paneer into small cubes.</p>
               
                    <p>Step 2 The prepration
                        Heat oil in a pan. Add asafoetida, cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter for a minute. Now add chopped onion and saute them for a few minutes until they turn golden. Now add all the veggies like carrot, capsicum, cauliflower, baby corn, beans and peas.</p>

                        Add salt, red chilli powder, dry mango powder, coriander powder, turmeric and give a nice mix. Now add 1/4 cup water.

                    <p>Step 4 Add paneer
                        Now open the lid, add paneer cubes, garam masala and give a gentle mix. Cook for another 5 minutes and switch off the flame.</p>
